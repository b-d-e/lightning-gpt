Based on Andrej Karpathy's '[NanoGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)' lecture (training a small transformer architecture on a shakespearean dataset), refactoring for training with PyTorch Lightning.

Character level tokenizer and decoder only transformer architecture trained with masked self-attention.

Training tested on an A100-40 and M2 Macbook.
